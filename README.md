# Calculator Readme.md

## Your first project is to create a simple calculator.  
## **BEFORE** you begin writing code:
- Clone the Calculator repository from github.com
- Create a new branch on the repository for you to save your work in. The branch should follow a "First-Name-First-Initial" pattern (ie. RichardH)
- Create a commit, and push your new branch to the remote repository

## Writing your code:
- A .NET 6 console application template has been provided for you in the repository. You should ust the Program.cs file to start work on your project.
- Remember to commit early and often. Commit and push your work regularly. This can help you roll back your work after a mistake, or even restore a project if you hav a computer problem.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
### Your application should:
- Be written in C# for .NET 6
- Be able to accept multiple numbers
- Perform a selected operation on those numbers
- Display the result of the operation
- Repeat until the user chooses to exit

## Stretch Goals
### Your application could also (but it doesn't have to):
- Accept number values and operations in a written input format (ie. "one plus one")
- Accept mixed format input (ie. "one plus 3")
- Accept multiple values (ie. "2 + 3 + 4")
- Perform multiple operations (ie. "2 - 1 + 3")
- Store a calculation history to a file.
- Accept inputs from a file, perform the required operations, then ouput those results to a file.

## Project Presentation:
- You should commit and push your project to GitHub before your presentation.
- You should expect to present your functioning project to the rest of the batch on Tuesday 3/15.
- Your presentation should be quick (between 3 and 5 minutes), and should feature a demonstration of your application running.
- If there is a section of code that you would like to show, you may. But the focus of your presentation should be on your functioning product.

## The Boring Stuff:
- This is an individual effort project. Your work must be your own. Plagerism will not be tolerated.
- Collaborate! You are the best resource you can offer to the rest of the cohort. Ask for others to review your code, and offer to help look at others.
- Use your toolbox. Every utility and application that is out there is available to you. You are not limited to nano or VS Code. If you know of another, try it out. Explore the options available.
